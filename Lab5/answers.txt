1.a.i. Does it make sense to have non-pre-emptive DIRECT tasks?

Yes, time is a critical factor for a DIRECT task. With preemption you loose all control over time.

1.a.ii. Does it make sense to disallow non-pre-emptive DIRECT tasks?
No, most DIRECT tasks can not be preempted. Think about communication with time critical (external) devices, when a quick response is needed by a DIRECT tasks, you cannot stop mid-way responding to do another task first.

1.a.iii. Does it make sense to allow a DIRECT task to be executed when a non-pre-emptive task is interrupted by the interrupt handler?

No, because the first task is non-pre-emptive, so it should never be interrupted. The DIRECT task has to wait (that's just the risk you get with non-pre-emptive tasks, starvation and deadline misses just arround the corner!)
